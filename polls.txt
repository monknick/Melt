Would you rather teleport anywhere or read minds?
Would you rather have a pause or a rewind button for life?
Would you rather always have to sing instead of speak or dance everywhere you go?
Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?
Would you rather be famous but poor, or rich but unknown?
